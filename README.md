Maliit Keyboard With Vietnamese TELEX
===============
This project is a streamlined adaptation of the Mallit Keyboard, incorporating Vietnamese Telex input functionality. It leverages the robust AVIM open-source Input Method Editor for JavaScript (https://sourceforge.net/projects/rhos/), resulting in a efficient solution to be integrated in Maliit.

Maliit Keyboard is a free software virtual keyboard for Linux systems with Wayland and X11 display servers. It supports many different languages and emoji. It is implemented as a plug-in for Maliit Framework.

Maliit Keyboard evolved from the [reference keyboard plug-in](https://github.com/maliit/plugins), [Ubuntu Keyboard](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu-keyboard) and [Lomiri Keyboard](https://github.com/maliit/keyboard/pull/60). Ubuntu Keyboard was a fork of the reference plugin which was taking into account the special UI/UX needs of Ubuntu Phone.
